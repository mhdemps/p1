            <h1>The Backrooms began as an image of empty yellow office space</h1></div>

            Posted online with a warning if you “no-clip” out of reality in the wrong place, you might end up here — an endless sprawl of rooms that exist only to connect other rooms. During lockdown, images like this spread rapidly online: vacant malls, deserted corridors, transitional spaces stripped of people but heavy with unease. They weren’t dramatic or violent — just wrong, humming with the sense that something had been abandoned too quickly.

            For Kane Parsons, these spaces were never just an internet trend. “It got me thinking about the feelings that spaces can evoke in a person,” he says. Raised on sandbox video games and glitchy digital environments, Parsons was fascinated by places with no clear function — the cracks in the world. “Industrial back corridors, storage rooms, crawlspaces, emergency exits, vacant offices,” he explains, “areas that rarely see use, but haven’t yet completely rotted away.”  
            His short film The Backrooms drops the viewer directly into these environments: endless office interiors rendered in degraded, analog textures that feel distant in time.

            <p>Parsons intentionally sets the story in the past, explaining that the “analogue appearance goes a long way in selling that ‘liminal feeling,’ or making it feel far away in time.” Without GPS, phones, or clear exits, the space becomes impossible to map or understand — a place that resists explanation.
            Online, the term liminal came to describe these kinds of images: spaces meant to be passed through, not stayed in. “It’s not like a living room or a library,” Parsons says, “but a gas station that you park at momentarily while you’re going across the country… spaces that are just there to conjoin other spaces.” The Backrooms takes that idea to its extreme, stretching transition into infinity.

            <p>Despite its viral origins, Parsons is careful to distance his work from meme culture. “The Backrooms is not — and never has been — something that I think about as an internet trend or a meme,” he says. “It’s just a story I genuinely care about.” The unease comes not from spectacle, but from architecture itself: repetition, scale, and the quiet horror of being trapped inside systems that feel familiar yet fundamentally indifferent.
            In the Backrooms, nothing is overtly wrong — and that’s exactly the problem.
