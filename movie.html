          What stood out most in this scholarly take on The Shining is the idea that the Overlook Hotel functions as a liminal space, a place where normal rules about time, identity, and reality begin to dissolve. Rather than serving as a simple haunted setting, the hotel operates as a threshold — a structure suspended between states, where boundaries blur instead of hold.

              The hotel is not just haunted; it exists between past and present, life and death, reality and illusion. Time folds in on itself. The 1921 ballroom party coexists with the Torrance family’s winter isolation. Hallways stretch endlessly, rooms seem architecturally impossible, and mirrors double characters until it becomes unclear which version is authentic. These in-between spaces allow ghosts to appear not as distant memories or hallucinations, but as physical presences that interact with doors, bodies, and space. The supernatural is never fully confirmed or denied — it simply occupies the same unstable plane as everything else.

              The article’s discussion of spectrality emphasizes that the film constantly hovers between explanation and uncertainty. It resists settling into either a psychological interpretation or a purely supernatural one. Even the camera feels disembodied at times, gliding through corridors without a visible operator, as if the hotel itself is watching. This perspective traps the viewer inside the same suspended logic as the characters. We are not given stable ground from which to interpret events.

                Identity, too, becomes liminal. Jack shifts between father and aggressor, struggling writer and reincarnated guest. The final photograph suggests he has always been part of the hotel’s history, absorbed into its cycle of repetition. Meaning in The Shining never fully resolves; it lingers in a permanent state of in-betweenness. The Overlook becomes a threshold where repetition replaces closure, and where the uncanny is not a fleeting disruption but a sustained condition.
