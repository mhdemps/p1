            What stood out most in this scholarly take on The Shining is the idea that the Overlook Hotel functions as a liminal space, a place where normal rules about time, identity, and reality break down.

            The hotel is not just haunted; it exists between past and present, life and death, reality and illusion. Hallways stretch endlessly, rooms feel disconnected, and mirrors double characters until it becomes unclear which version is real. These in-between spaces allow ghosts to appear as solid presences rather than distant memories or hallucinations.

            <p>
              The article’s discussion of spectrality emphasizes that the film is constantly hovering between explanation and uncertainty. Even the camera seems ghostly at times, moving without a clear human point of view. This makes the viewer feel trapped in the same unstable environment as the characters.

              The hotel becomes a threshold where meaning never fully settles, and where the uncanny feels permanent rather than momentary.
