                <h1> What makes Severance unsettling isn’t what happens — it’s where it happens. </h1></div>

            From the start, the show demands attention through its environments: quiet, sterile corporate interiors that feel suspended outside normal time. The world of Severance is built almost entirely from office space, but stripped down to something colder and more abstract, where architecture seems to watch back.

            The Lumon office is designed as a kind of controlled limbo.

              Endless white hallways stretch far beyond what feels reasonable, broken only by sparse art and occasional rooms that suggest purpose without ever explaining it. The lack of windows and natural light flattens time, making every space feel continuous and interchangeable. These are not places meant to be personalized or inhabited — they are places meant to contain.
            
            Production designer Jeremy Hindle drew inspiration from mid-century corporate architecture, creating interiors that feel familiar yet placeless. Hallways were built long enough to emphasize duration and repetition, reinforcing the sensation of being lost inside a system rather than a building. The effect is subtle but cumulative: walking becomes an act of endurance, not transit.

            Lighting plays a crucial role in maintaining this unease. Cinematographer Jessica Lee Gagné leaned into artificial illumination, treating each room as its own sealed environment. Even moments meant to feel lighter or warmer are defined by controlled, deliberate lighting choices, reminding viewers that nothing here is accidental. Color appears rarely, and when it does, it feels loaded — symbolic rather than comforting.
            
            Props and furniture further remove the space from any recognizable present. Computers, desks, and office tools are custom-designed to look almost familiar, but not quite — as if technology stalled or evolved incorrectly. These objects reinforce the sense that the workplace exists in a closed loop, disconnected from the outside world and ordinary time.

            What Severance ultimately achieves through its set design is a form of architectural horror. The spaces are clean, quiet, and meticulously ordered — yet deeply oppressive. Nothing is visibly wrong, but everything feels off. The office becomes less a backdrop and more a psychological mechanism, shaping behavior through repetition, isolation, and scale.
            
            In Severance, liminal space isn’t transitional — it’s permanent.
